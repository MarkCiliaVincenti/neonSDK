Neon.Deployment
===============

Extends **GitHub** and **LibGit2Sharp** with handy higer level utilities.  Note that this replicates
some of the functionality provided by **Neon.Deployment**.  Perhaps someday we'll have **Neon.Deployment**
pick up these capabilities from this library or potentially combine the libraries.

You can get started here: [Neon.Docker](https://sdk.neonforge.com/N_Neon_GitHub.htm)
