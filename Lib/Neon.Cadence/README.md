Neon.Cadence
============

---

**NOTE:** We're going to be **deprecating support for Uber Cadence in the near future** and will be transitioning to the official client being developed by [temporal.io](https://temporal.io/).

---

A .NET client for the Uber Cadence workflow platform.

We have been running simple workflows in production using the **Neon.Cadence** client for a couple years now.  This is lacking a few somewhat advanced features like being able to wait on multiple operations simultaneously in a workflow as well as an in-process workflow engine for better unit testing support. Our current plan is to add these features to the nacent **Neon.Temporal** port.  We're not planning on back porting these to **Neon.Cadence**.
